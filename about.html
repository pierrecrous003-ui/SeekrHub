            SeekrHub is an independent informational platform designed to help people
            understand professional roles across different countries and regions.
            The site provides structured, country-specific overviews of common
            professional roles, including typical responsibilities, skills, and how
            those roles may vary depending on local markets and working environments.

            The purpose of SeekrHub is to make it easier for job seekers, professionals,
            researchers, and curious readers to explore how careers are shaped globally.
            Professional role titles often appear similar across countries, but
            expectations, responsibilities, and industry focus can differ significantly
            depending on regional business practices, regulations, and market maturity.
